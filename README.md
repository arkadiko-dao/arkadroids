# Arkadroids

In a distant future, the world has become interconnected by a vast electronic network that permeates every aspect of life. This network was discovered in the Arkadiko laboratory when it was found that Blockchain and its encrypted energy could be used as a power source for the first successful humanoid AI- the Arkadroid. In their research, the team at Arkadiko also discovered this newly found energy source could be used as a cybernetic implant allowing humans to access the data of the open source network of Bitcoin and Stacks freely. As much as these discoveries are breakthroughs they have opened up gateways to even more confusion on the questions of humanity. Will Humanity be able to coexist with the Arkadroids? Time will tell.Â
